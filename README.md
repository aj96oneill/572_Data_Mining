CSE 572 Data Mining Projects

Part 1:
Handle asynchronous temporal data, interpolate and clean the data, and then calculate 36 metrics based set ranges during each day and the average percentage of each metricâ€™s values for all days

Part 2:
Find all locations in insulin data file where patient records carbs intake and a 2 hour window after without any more recorded carbs. Then find indexes of 2 hour chunks of time after where no food was recorded. This is done for 2 patients, the data is combined, cleaned, interpolated. Then the features are extracted and a machine learning algorithm is trained on the feature matrix. Different models were tested and evaluated using recall, precision, and F1 score using k-fold validation to pick the best model.
The model is then saved and used again on a test file, where data is read, features extracted, and then predictions are outputted in a csv file.
